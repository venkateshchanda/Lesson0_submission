            	2.HTML Tags in html tags section I have learnt some bunch of HTML Tags.<br>Some of them are<br> 
                  <ul>
                  <li><b> bold Tag</b></li><br>
            	  <li><em>Italics Tag</em></li><br>
            	  <li>break tag (br inside < >).</li><br>
            	  <li>image tag.</li><br>
            	  <li>paragraph tag.</li><br>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            3.Inline/Block<br> inline is something with no extra boundrays around it.It is just plain text.block is something 
            like text bounded by invisible boundary.<br>Some of the examples of inline are br,img,em tags and text.<br>paragraph p is block.<br> 
            </p>
            <p>
            4.span/div:<br>Again span is something which acts as inline and div is something which acts as block
            </p>
